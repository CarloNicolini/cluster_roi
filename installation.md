pyClusterROI requires [Python](http://www.python.org/) along with the [NiBabel](http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nibabel/),
 [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) Python libraries. The easiest method for installing
 python on Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X (and Linux) is to use a Python distribution such as [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com), [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), or [ActivePython](http://www.activestate.com/activepython). These packages come pre-installed with SciPy and NumPy.
